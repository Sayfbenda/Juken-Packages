# nanos-world-weapons

This is a Package which contains a bunch of weapons Classes defined using meshes already included in nanos world Default Asset Pack.


## Usage

```lua
AK47(Vector(123, 456, 100), Rotator())
```


## Full Example

```lua
-- Spawning the AK47
local my_ak47 = AK47(Vector(0, 0, 300), Rotator())

-- Adds a StaticMesh Attached with a RedDot mesh into AK47. As our AK47 model doesn't have a
-- bone at the correct location of the sights, we need to manually offset it to match the location,
-- otherwise we could just attach to the bone/socket directly
my_ak47:AddStaticMeshAttached("sight", "nanos-world::SM_T4_Sight", "", Vector(23, -0, 12))

-- Makes the FOV multiplier reduces by 0.35x when ADS (aiming)
my_ak47.SightFOVMultiplier = 0.35

-- Sets the ADS transform offset to fit the RedDot center position,
-- each weapon will need a different offset to fit it's sight. AK47 + RedDot best fit is Z = -2
my_ak47:SetSightTransform(Vector(0, 0, -2), Rotator(0, 0, 0))
```

Note you can use any Static Mesh and attach to the weapon, also you can use any Skeletal Mesh and build you own weapon.
